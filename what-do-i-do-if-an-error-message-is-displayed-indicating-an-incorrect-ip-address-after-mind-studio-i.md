## Solution<a name="section6143113133617"></a>

Check the IP address configuration because the connection is abnormal. It is found that the IP address configuration is correct. It is found that  **https://**  is not entered during login. This situation is the same as the default input  **http://**, both of which cannot be identified.

Log in to the system at https://\*\*\*\*:8888/dashboard/\#/. The login is successful.
