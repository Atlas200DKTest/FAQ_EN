The DVPP hardware does not support progressive encoding. Therefore, non-progressive encoding JPEG pictures are required. For details about progressive JPEG pictures, visit the following link:  [https://www.jianshu.com/p/e1b9d9aa9fc0](https://www.jianshu.com/p/e1b9d9aa9fc0)

For details about image formats supported by DVPP, see the  _DVPP API Reference_.
